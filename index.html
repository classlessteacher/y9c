<h1>The super hanger deluxe by Sophie, Ruby and Marc</h1>
<h2>Our goals</h2>
<p> Our main goal throughout this whole process was to be able to help people who find everyday things a struggle and to help make thier lives that much easier. We started off wanting to make a product for the current situation (COVID-19). Our first plan was to help poeple who cant afford to keep buying masks. However, we realized that this particullar product would only be popular DURING the COVID-19 breakout and might not be as successful in a everday situation. Therefore, we decided that it would be best if we went with our next option which is the 'super hanger deluxe'.</p>
<h2>What is the Super Hanger Deluxe?</h2>
<p>The super hanger deluxe is mainly towards people who are disabled and have to stay in a wheelchair due to a disease or accident. We want to be able to help them to be able to do at least one thing that they do everyday a little easier to improve thier lives.</p>
<h3> How is this product made? </h3>
<p> The 'Super Hanger Deluxe'is made using only 4 materials: a coat hanger, tape, rocks and a balloon we got from a 99C store (which shows that we supported independant stores aroung NYC). Our first draft sarted of by using an old, emmpty mini knock off version of squash and attached it tot he hanger by string. However, this did not work because the suqah bottle was too light in order to make the main point of the machine to work (the part where it automatically goes up onits own to reduce the amount of work).</p>
