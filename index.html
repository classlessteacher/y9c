<h1>The super hanger deluxe by Sophie, Ruby and Marc</h1>
<h2>Our goals</h2>
<p> Our main goal throughout this whole process was to be able to help people who find everyday things a struggle and to help make thier lives that much easier. We started off wanting to make a product for the current situation (COVID-19). Our first plan was to help poeple who cant afford to keep buying masks. However, we realized that this particullar product would only be popular DURING the COVID-19 breakout and might not be as successful in a everday situation. Therefore, we decided that it would be best if we went with our next option which is the 'super hanger deluxe'.</p>
<h2>What is the Super Hanger Deluxe?)</h2>
<p>The super hanger deluxe is mainly towards people who are disabled and have to stay in a wheelchair due to a disease or accident. We want to be able to help them to be able to do at least one thing that they do everyday a little easier to improve thier lives.</p>
